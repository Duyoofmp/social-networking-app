# Mini Social network


## Solution and choice made

To build a mini social network web application, I used the ReactJS library for the frontend and Firebase for the backend. ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, while Firebase provides a cloud-based backend service that includes authentication, real-time database, and storage.

The app allows users to sign up and create a profile for themselves, which includes their name, email,username and profile picture. Users can search for other users by name or username and view their profiles. They can also make them friend by clicking follow button and view the list of friends.

Finally, I implemented the mutual friends feature by comparing the list of friends of two users and displaying the list of mutual friends. This is done by querying the database for the list of friends of each user and then finding the intersection of those lists.

Overall, using ReactJS and Firebase allowed for a quick and efficient development process while also providing robust functionality for the mini social network web application.
